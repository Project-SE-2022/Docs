The Management Web UI, like the Client's UI, was developed using React JS.

It has a main file called *"index.js"* that runs firstly the connection with our IDP (Identity Provider), keycloak. It verifies if the user logged has or not permissions to access this page. Only users with *admin* role has authorization to see this UI.

After this verification, the UI will render the app if the user has permissions, or will show a message warning about his lack of authorization.
